### üëã Hi ‚Äî I'm Priyanka 

After 4+ years bridging the gap between messy data and meaningful growth, I‚Äôve gone from the west coast of India to the Bay Area, chasing the kind of business questions that keep teams up at night. I believe the best stories in analytics start with ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù ‚Äî Why does a campaign flatline after a promising start? Why do high-value customers suddenly churn? Why do certain metrics sound impressive but mean nothing to the bottom line?

My passion sits at the intersection of marketing and data. For me, analysis isn‚Äôt just about charts and dashboards; it‚Äôs about turning funnel leaks into conversion lift, transforming acquisition spend into LTV, and building frameworks that help teams prioritize signal over noise. Whether it‚Äôs isolating true campaign ROI from attribution fog, modeling next-quarter revenue shocks, or architecting GTM analytics for product launches, I thrive on making data make sense.

I love creating clarity in chaos ‚Äî designing KPI ecosystems that cut through vanity metrics, running A/B tests that reshape growth strategy, and using scenario modeling to turn what-ifs into concrete plans. My drive is to answer the tough questions: What *should* we measure? What metric moves the business forward? And how can marketing analytics become the lever that turns insight into revenue?

After completing my master's in Information Systems in San Francisco, I'm laser-focused on one thing: partnering with teams where data-driven decision making isn't just buzzword compliance ‚Äî it's the competitive advantage that scales revenue, optimizes acquisition costs, and turns retention into a growth engine.

**My sweet spot?** High-stakes environments where "let me model that scenario" leads to million-dollar reallocations, where SQL queries unlock growth hypotheses, and where the right segmentation strategy can transform entire customer lifecycles.

Ready to turn your growth questions into revenue answers? Let's connect.
